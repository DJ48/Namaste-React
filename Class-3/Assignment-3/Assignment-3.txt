Q4.     {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}
        in JSX?
Ans-    {TitleComponent} -> In this way it is invoking TitleComponent function and 
                                executing like JS code.

        <TitleComponent/>-> This syntax is a shorthand for creating and rendering an
                                instance of the TitleComponent without passing any 
                                children to it. This is suitable when you want to 
                                render the TitleComponent as a self-contained element 
                                without any child elements or content.

        <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> :- Use {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} 
                                                when you want to include child 
                                                elements or content within the 
                                                TitleComponent.
                                                ex:-
                                                <TitleComponent>
                                                        <span>Some content</span>
                                                </TitleComponent>
